"The Thrash Particle"

Didn't watch your exâ€™s set. I just left and thought about you;
like when your teeth graze those lips, when you begin to smile.
Later, you took my hand. You lead us to the doorway,
but you let go of me once you saw all your friends.

And I've known you forever. At least that's what I tell Jake,
when I'm too drunk to walk home, when your brother's away.
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met,
but I can't seem to remember where or when.

Couldn't watch your ex's set. Instead I wrote this song about you.
Thought, "would you show your kids, if you found the time was right?"
You'd tell them where and when. You never thought I'd leave the east coast.
We were young and full of sin. And I too dumb to understand.

Yet I've loved you forever. At least that's what I tell Holt,
when I'm too drunk to lie, too drugged to be alone.
You suggested I write a song about the first time we met,
well I don't wanna remember there or then.

So, is this the hook you wanted?
Is it stuck inside your head?
Can you sing it with your friends, or alone?
So, am I what you needed?
Say you love me to my face,
grin and gossip, walk away and then go...

"So is this the hook you wanted?
To sing about me to my friends?
Well you're just stuck inside your head, all alone.
Oh, you were all I needed.
Said I loved you to your face,
but you just laughed and walked away."
